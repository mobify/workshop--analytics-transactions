#Adaptive.js Analytics Workshop
The example site for this workshop is [Merlin's Potions](https://github.com/mobify/workshop--hijax/tree/master), a mock e-commerce site that peddles potions and spell books.

In this workshop you'll learn how to send transaction data to google analytics.

We use Git to switch between the steps in the workshop. Look through some of [Git's documentation](https://github.com/mobify/workshop--hijax/tree/master) if you're not already familiar with Git. Also, we use Require.js in most of the JavaScript files in the project. Its documentation is found [here](http://requirejs.org/docs/start.html).
